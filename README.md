# Animation Gallery

Live site: https://csinclair89.github.io/AnimApp

This repository is intended to serve as a webdev sandbox as I try to build out a GIF library that incorporates common aspects of social networks such as likes/unlikes, subscribers, a search engine, and profile pages. It's quite skeletal at the moment, but a list of implementation goals can be found below.

#### UI Items:
1. [x] Basic search bar (client-side only)
2. [x] Responsive for desktop, tablet, & mobile
3. [ ] Flip Cards ("Info" button for metadata on back)
4. [ ] Staggered rows
5. [ ] "Infinite scrolling" up to ~10 sections
6. [ ] Animated buttons, overlays, logo, background

#### UX Items:
1. [x] Basic authentication (Google OAuth2 API)
2. [x] Likes/Unlikes
3. [x] Upload/Delete
4. [ ] "Share/Clipboard" button for copying embedding link
5. [ ] Profile page
6. [ ] 'Liked' and 'My Feed' pages
7. [ ] Comments section in Gallery Overlay
8. [ ] Robust authentication via dedicated auth service

#### Functionality Items:
1. [ ] Server-side search bar
2. [ ] Integrate Multer library for large uploads
3. [ ] Utilize prefetching for full res GIFs
4. [ ] GIF compression/conversion to more optimal filetype?
5. [ ] Algorithm for main gallery

Enjoy! - Chris
